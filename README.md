# lil-critters

This is a Unity project that seeks to simulate evolution of biological creatures (Critters). The application is similar to an ant farm where a user does not interact with the critters and instead just watches them as they attempt to survive and replicate.

The long term goal is to add simple neural networks to act as the brains for the critters which connect sensory input with action output.

This project is open source. Development on it is streamed: https://www.twitch.tv/robotmonkeybrain
